This is an example application intended to be used as a starting point for the final project in [INLS 490-186 Web Information Organization](http://aeshin.org/teaching/inls-490-186/2012/sp/).

You will want to start by [forking](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) this repository so you have your own copy to modify. If you decide to work in a group, I will put a copy of the code in your shared repository. (While it's possible to collaborate with your group by pushing and pulling commits across your two or three separate forks, doing so requires somewhat advanced knowledge of Git and thus isn't expected for this assignment.)

If you're working alone, please **rename your GitHub repository** to something more suitable for your service. You can do this by clicking on the ![admin](doc/img/admin.png) button from your repository's page on GitHub. (If you're working in a group the repository will be named after your group).
